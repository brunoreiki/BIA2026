# About the Student feedback (deferred) behaviour

This question behaviour is derived from the Deferred feedback behaviour, and questions will behave essentially the same.

With this behaviour however, students can submit one comment for each question and one comment for the whole Quiz, after their attempt is submitted.  
These comments are editable by the student, and are visible by the teachers.

# Setup

Once installed, simply go to a Quiz settings > Question behaviour > Select "Student feedback (deferred)".

# Quiz report

Students feedback can be viewed within the quiz report interface using the quiz_feedback plugin.
